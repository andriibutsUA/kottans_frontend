I have just completed How to Use Git and GitHub by Udacity. I learned about different control systems and Git in particular. Now I know how to create, fork and clone a repository.

The most important things from the course are branching, merging, resolving merge conflicts and making pull requests. These skills will help me to work in a team on a project which is pretty cool, I guess.
